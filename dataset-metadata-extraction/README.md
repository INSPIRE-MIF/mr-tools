# INSPIRE Monitoring and Reporting 2023 - Dataset metadata extraction

This folder contains a set of SQL queries to automatically extract from each Member State/EFTA Country endpoint the dataset metadata records harvested for the the INSPIRE Monitoring and Reporting (M&R) 2023 process.
Two fields are obtained in this process: fileIdentier (uuid) and the XML metadata record (data).

The results for each endpoint were packed in a .CSV file, which was used as input for the tools evaluating the Accessibility of datasets.
